everything functionality-wise is done for postgresql

I have the text searching down, it looks like you need %San Pedro% to cover
things that will contain that, otherwise "San Pedro" will only match that
exactly (no leading, trailing chars)


otherwise, have DB connections working, will be able to build strings
make sure to use the psycopg docs to sanitize strings

later can consider switching to some kind of ORM or such
