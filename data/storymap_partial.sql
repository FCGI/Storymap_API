This dark red, oxidized sandstone resists erosion and is a cliff former in Grand Canyon.

85	3	Bryozoa from the Supai Group	https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5679/23315316669_47883a8b66_k.jpg	Bryozoa and corals are marine invertebrate organisms that form colonies. They are characterized by branching, lacy, or fan-like structures. The Bryozoa were one of three major groups of organisms that dominated the Paleozoic Era spanning about 540 million to 250 million years ago. Over 15,000 species of bryozoa have been found in the fossil record, while approximately 4,000 species are extant today.

86	3	Brachiopods from the Supai Group	https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5679/23055122044_116164828a_k.jpg	Brachiopods are marine filter feeding, immobile bottom dwellers. They inhabit a variety of seafloor environments, such as those existing during Permian to Pennsylvanian times. Many brachiopods are immobile, rooted by their pedicle (a fleshy stalk protruding from their shell) to a hard surface like a rocky outcrop or boulder. They use an internal structure called a lophophore to bring water into their shell to collect food particles.

Their shells, known as tests, were composed of hard calcium carbonate. Fusilinids, or Fusulinida, are an extinct order of Foraminifera, and their fossils are often used to identify Mississippian- to Permian-aged rock.

It comprises red-stained limestone, dolostone and cherty lenses; the reddish color is a surface stain from weathering of the overlying Supai Group. Marine fossils common to the Redwall, and still seen today, include: corals, brachiopods, bryozoans, and sharks. The Redwall formed in the Mississippian (359 to 323 Ma) at a time when the western North American continent was covered by a shallow sea.	-12477659.12	4311782.496	102100	0101000020E6100000DC5A5A92AD055CC0AFF43A91600A4240
89	3	Crinoids from the Redwall Limestone	https://farm1.staticflickr.com/666/23315322889_cb13f43022_k.jpg	Crinoids are a type of Echinoderm, related to sea urchins, starfish, and sea cucumbers. Crinoids have three main body parts: the stem, the calyx (a cup containing the mouth and digestive system), and food-gathering arms. They are sometimes called sea lilies due to their flower-like shape, and have existed at least 490 million years from the beginning of the Ordovician period to the present. This crinoid fossil formed about 360 to 320 million years ago during the Mississippian period.

To the north, the Mesa Butte Fault forms the Mesa Butte Graben before encountering the junction of the Coconino Point Monocline and the Black Point Monocline. </p><p>A geochronologic study shows five episodes of volcanism along Mesa Butte Fault occurring over a period of about 1-million years. (Magma rising through the crust is opportunistic and will frequently follow low-stress regimes of fractures or faults.) The final two episodes produced Red Mountain (750+/-100 ka) and Shadow Mountain (300+/-100 ka). The long-lived nature of volcanism along the fault rivals activity at the San Francisco Mountain composite volcano. The volume of erupted materials, however, is a fraction of the volcanic production at San Francisco Mountain, which produced about 22 cubic miles (92 cubic km) of eruptive products. <br /></p><p>The Mesa Butte volcanic vent alignment is but one of a number of vent alignments cropping out along normal faults in the field.

Situated immediately south of SP Crater, Colton is one of the larger – 1 mile (1.6 km) in diameter at the base - and more complex cinder cones in the San Francisco field.</p><p>Following cone construction, Colton Crater experienced a major phreatomagmatic (groundwater-magma interaction) explosion that hollowed out the central core of the cone. The resulting explosion caldera is ~3,800-feet (1158 m) in diameter and more than 600-feet (182 m) deep.&nbsp; <br /></p><p>Phreatomagmatic blasts send pyroclastic surges (dense clouds of ash, rock and gas) racing over the crater rim.

An agglutinate of fused volcanic bombs and spatter mantles the summit and protects the vent from rapid erosion and degradation. Volcanic bombs the size of reclining chairs rest comfortably atop the summit rim.

Volcanologists refer to this as a collapse caldera because it formed during massive sector or flank collapse of the weak composite volcano interior. Prior to collapse, the summit elevation - now at ~ 12,600 feet (3,840 m) - approached 16,000 feet (4876 m). The debris avalanche that accompanied collapse ran out to the east, where it came to rest just west of present-day Sunset Crater. </p><p>It remains an open question when collapse occurred, but it does predate the Sugarloaf Dome, which squats on the east flank of the mountain.</p><p>The Inner Crater was sculpted, in part, by Pleistocene alpine glaciation leaving behind cirques, lateral moraines, and glacial erratics. <br /></p><p>Image: Inner Crater of San Francisco in fall 2018 (10/10/2018).

Sunset Crater, the youngest volcano in the San Francisco volcanic field, was active about 1064 CE. </p><p>The cone rises 1000 feet (300 m) and has a basal diameter of ~ 0.75 miles (1.20 km). Violent Strombolian blasts threw alkali-olivine basalt bombs, cinders and ash high above the central vent; the heavier material fell back to construct the central cone while the ash was transported by prevailing winds to the south-southeast. Aa lava flows effused from the west base (Bonito flow) and the east base (Kana-a flow). Sections of the cinder cone were disrupted and fragments (agglutinate mounds) rafted northwest of the cone. Later Strombolian eruptions healed the cone flank and partially blanketed the fresh lava flows with cinders and ash. </p><p>The Sinagua people living near the active vent abandoned their pit houses to escape cinder- and ash-fall.

An early researcher in the San Francisco volcanic field, Colton devised a relative dating strategy to ‘age’ cinder cones in the field. He was instrumental in preserving Sunset Crater, the youngest of 600+ volcanoes (cinder cone) in the San Francisco volcanic field. ‘Major’ Brady focused on the paleontology of the southern Colorado Plateau. </p><p>In 1941, Dr. Edwin “Eddie” McKee – a legendary figure in Colorado Plateau studies - became Assistant Director of MNA.

Lava River Cave on the edge of Government Prairie in the Coconino National Forest is well known and accessible. (A smaller lava tube – Sunset Crater’s ice cave - is gated to prevent entry.) Lava tubes form as the top and bottom of the flow insulate the flow interior from cooling, allowing the interior flow to drain from the tube. According to Laszlo Keszthelyi, ‘lava flowing in a tube loses only about 1Cº of heat/kilometer’. That’s remarkably efficient and permits lava flows to travel miles (kilometers) downstream from the vent. </p><p>Lava River Cave is about 0.75 miles (1.20 km) long and up to tens of feet wide. The adit (entrance) is littered with damp boulders and the footing treacherous. The cave is open to the public but take care, don’t go alone, and each person should carry several flashlights.

About 50,000 years ago, a nickel-iron meteorite weighing 300,000 tons and 160 feet (49 m) in diameter traveling at 8 miles (12.9 km) per second blasted a crater ~ 4,000 feet (~1220 m) in diameter and 750 feet deep (~ 230 m). Crater fragments – some are quite large – are collectively referred to as the Canyon Diablo meteorite. </p><p>In 1903, Daniel M. Barringer, a mining engineer, postulated that the crater was the result of a meteorite impact. His company, Standard Iron Company, patented the land and the Barringer family owns the land to this day. Barringer’s meteorite origin was largely scoffed at and remained controversial into the 1950s. Eugene Shoemaker’s groundbreaking work here in 1960 confirmed Barringer’s hypothesis. </p><p>The powerful impact threw chunks of the existing Moenkopi, Kaibab, Toroweap Formations and the Coconino Sandstone into the air. They fell to the ground in reverse order resulting in the inverted stratigraphy found up to 1 mile (1.6 km) outboard of the rim. </p><p>From the work of David Kring and Jake Bailey (NASA/UA Space Imagery Center’s Impact Cratering Series), “sum of these effects is the destruction of vegetation over an area 300 to&nbsp; 580 square miles (800 to 1500 km2). Damage to vegetation would have extended over an additional 77 to&nbsp; 231 square miles (200 to 600 km2). Animals within 1.8 to 6.5 miles (3 to 10 km) of the impact site probably would been killed, with maiming injuries extending out to distances of about 10 to 15 miles (16 to 24 km). While these effects are severe, they are confined to the immediate region and did not cause extinctions. In fact, the newly formed bowl shaped depression soon filled with water providing a lake habitat (see graphic) for aquatic plants and animals. Recolonization of the area was probably accomplished in a few to ~100 years.”</p><p>Image: Meteor Crater aerial photo by Dale Nations (Northern Arizona University).
