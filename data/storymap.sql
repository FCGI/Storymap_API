Archaeologists interpret it as a trade center because of the special items found there, including macaw remains that show connections to Mexico and shells and shell artifacts that show connections to the California coast.” A short, easy trail meanders through the piney ruins. The Pueblo walls are built of block-sized, volcanic basalt cobbles. On close inspection, the cobbles are peppered with small spherical to irregular shaped holes. These holes - called vesicles by volcanologists - form as gases, mostly H2O with minor carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, escape from the cooling basaltic lava. <br /></p><p>Image.

To the north, the Mesa Butte Fault forms the Mesa Butte Graben before encountering the junction of the Coconino Point Monocline and the Black Point Monocline. </p><p>A geochronologic study shows five episodes of volcanism along Mesa Butte Fault occurring over a period of about 1-million years. (Magma rising through the crust is opportunistic and will frequently follow low-stress regimes of fractures or faults.) The final two episodes produced Red Mountain (750+/-100 ka) and Shadow Mountain (300+/-100 ka). The long-lived nature of volcanism along the fault rivals activity at the San Francisco Mountain composite volcano.

Volcanologists refer to this as a collapse caldera because it formed during massive sector or flank collapse of the weak composite volcano interior. Prior to collapse, the summit elevation - now at ~ 12,600 feet (3,840 m) - approached 16,000 feet (4876 m).

Sunset Crater, the youngest volcano in the San Francisco volcanic field, was active about 1064 CE. </p><p>The cone rises 1000 feet (300 m) and has a basal diameter of ~ 0.75 miles (1.20 km). Violent Strombolian blasts threw alkali-olivine basalt bombs, cinders and ash high above the central vent; the heavier material fell back to construct the central cone while the ash was transported by prevailing winds to the south-southeast. Aa lava flows effused from the west base (Bonito flow) and the east base (Kana-a flow). Sections of the cinder cone were disrupted and fragments (agglutinate mounds) rafted northwest of the cone. Later Strombolian eruptions healed the cone flank and partially blanketed the fresh lava flows with cinders and ash. </p><p>The Sinagua people living near the active vent abandoned their pit houses to escape cinder- and ash-fall.

Lava River Cave on the edge of Government Prairie in the Coconino National Forest is well known and accessible. (A smaller lava tube – Sunset Crater’s ice cave - is gated to prevent entry.) Lava tubes form as the top and bottom of the flow insulate the flow interior from cooling, allowing the interior flow to drain from the tube. According to Laszlo Keszthelyi, ‘lava flowing in a tube loses only about 1Cº of heat/kilometer’. That’s remarkably efficient and permits lava flows to travel miles (kilometers) downstream from the vent. </p><p>Lava River Cave is about 0.75 miles (1.20 km) long and up to tens of feet wide.

Its source vent is unknown. The lava flowed down-gradient from the north-central reach of the field to the northeast. The prominent brecciated flow front is ~ 4 miles (6.4 km)&nbsp; across and encroaches on the floodplain of the Little Colorado River. </p><p>According to Sarah Hanson (Adrian College, Adrian, MI) Black Point flow erupted about 865,000 to 870,000 years ago, coeval with the eruption of the Citadel lava flow. (The two lava flows share identical geochemical, mineralogical and petrological qualities; Hanson hypothesizes that they may be separate flow fronts from a single lava effusive event.) </p><p>The Black Point lava slowly flowed across the Permian Kaibab Limestone and crept over the face of the Black Point Monocline before finally stalling out on red beds of the Triassic Moenkopi Formation.

This fish prefers relatively small streams with gravel bottoms and gentle gradients. Adults migrate from sea into streams to spawn. The young fish stay in the stream for a year or two before entering the sea, but some populations never make it to the sea. This species does not compete well with other fish, tends to hybridize, and is unable to withstand depletion of stocks.	-12369599	6035449	102100	0101000020E6100000D7A22A498DC75BC0A090C0FED4C84740
304	16	Thirteen-lined Ground Squirrel	http://lecl.smugmug.com/New2ScienceANIMALS/i-LPrczdV/0/L/Thirteen%20lined%20ground%20squirrel-L.jpg	Lewis described a living specimen caught near Great Falls. Favoring short, dry grasslands, they are now widespread. They are often seen standing on their hind legs on roadsides or other places where grass is mowed. Like most ground squirrels, they hibernate. In hibernation, their heartbeat slows from more than 200 beats per minute to no more than five. 	-12390082	6018966	102100	0101000020E6100000DD7427F953D35BC0D201614308BC4740
305	16	Long-billed Curlew	"http://lecl.smugmug.com/New2ScienceANIMALS/i-3bTkWTB/0/L/Long-billed%20curlew-L.jpg	Lewis first described it near Great Falls. This is the largest North American shorebird. It has an extremely long, down-curved bill that is unmistakable. Its population seriously declined in the late 1800's due to hunting and more recently has suffered from the conversion of grasslands to agriculture. 	-12403106	6026709	102100	0101000020E6100000947663D8D0DA5BC0A937CE4E0CC24740
306	16	Bushy-tailed Woodrat	http://lecl.smugmug.com/New2ScienceANIMALS/i-dxkpqtD/0/L/Bushy-tailed%20woodrat-L.jpg	Lewis described a bushy-tailed woodrat found among the cargo at Great Falls. Known as "packrats" from large nest caches. They are highly territorial. A male will permit a female in his territory, but not another male. 	-12389414	6017648	102100	0101000020E61000005E6533A8F1D25BC02CD271FB01BB4740
307	16	Western Meadowlark	http://lecl.smugmug.com/New2ScienceANIMALS/i-kTwmcBS/0/L/Western%20meadowlark-L.jpg	Lewis first described this bird near Great Falls, Montana. The Western Meadowlark is extremely similar to the Eastern Meadowlark in color and pattern, but has a very different song. Named by the Audubon Society because Lewis' use of the song as the way to tell the two species apart was unheeded.The two generally do not interbreed where their ranges overlap and hybrids are largely sterile. They do actively defend their territories against members of other species. 	-12389080	6016825	102100	0101000020E61000009F5DB97FC0D25BC01D19822F5EBA4740
308	16	Swift Fox	http://lecl.smugmug.com/New2ScienceANIMALS/i-qxdNfQR/0/L/Swift%20fox-L.jpg	This is a cat-sized, large-eared fox of the central plains. They are primarily nocturnal but can sometimes be seen sunning themselves near the entrance to a den. They live on grasslands just east of the Rocky Mountains. Harvest and loss of habitat due to agriculture reduced their range by 40 percent.	-12389291	6016734	102100	0101000020E61000008734CC8DDFD25BC0A9CACD124CBA4740

312	16	Pinyon Jay	http://lecl.smugmug.com/New2ScienceANIMALS/i-WrKBqjh/0/L/Pinyon%20jay-L.jpg	Lewis first encountered this blue bird on the Jefferson River and compared it to robins for size and noted its habits, providing the first description for this species. Its name derives from its close association with the pinyon pine, a collective name for a number of pine species bearing cones that produce edible seeds.	-12467449	5760021	102100	0101000020E61000005076B2D8CEFF5BC0DAAC4287BEEF4640
313	16	Mountain Goat	http://lecl.smugmug.com/New2ScienceANIMALS/i-p5tBXFf/0/L/Mountain%20goat-L.jpg	Known only from skins and native reports until Clark "saw one at a distance" in the Lemhi area. Lewis did not describe until Fort Clatsop. Mountain goats live on remarkably steep, craggy cliffs for most of their lives. These steep slopes protect them from predators such as mountain lions and grizzy bears. Their high-altitude habitat is harsh and juvenile mortality is high. Goats that survive to adulthood tend not to live beyond 10 years.	-12576431	5619475	102100	0101000020E610000017D98BD0763E5CC0E718EFFC557E4640
314	16	Clark's Nutcracker	http://lecl.smugmug.com/New2ScienceANIMALS/i-qL7fdMQ/0/L/Clarks%20nutcracker-L.jpg	They are native permanent residents of the mountainous areas of the western United States. Their diet is limited to large-seeded pines of mountains. As a result, some tree species rely on these birds for seed dispersal. 	-12692760	5685983	102100	0101000020E61000001950341D58815CC0E92A6E5439B44640

Except when nesting, they generally live in flocks. Nestlings are fed by both parents. 	-12872541	5830650	102100	0101000020E61000006DD50147B4E85CC0FDBE095010284740
317	16	Franklin's Grouse	http://lecl.smugmug.com/New2ScienceANIMALS/i-cGbsnk4/0/L/Franklins%20grouse-L.jpg	 When Clark first encountered Spruce Grouse on the Lolo Pass, he was more concerned about eating it than describing it. Franklin's grouse is a medium size, short-necked, stocky and short-tailed grouse. Males are distinguished by the black neck and breast patch which is bordered by white-tipped feathers. Most noticeable on the males is the bright red patch of bare skin directly above the each eye. Females lack this bright red skin patch and are barred on the head and much of their under-parts with black, gray and white.	-12872207	5830973	102100	0101000020E6100000ADCD871E83E85CC0E624D7FB51284740

The creek winds through entrenched meanders, testimony to downcutting sometime in the past several million years. The canyon rim elevation is 6,690 ft (2,040 m); the canyon's floor is 350 ft lower. The Sinagua people settled here between 1125 and 1250 CE. They build stone walls to enclose natural recesses in the Permian Kaibab Limestone as habitation space; the ceilings are coated with soot from fires that largely died out around 1250 CE. </p><p>Cropping out below the Kaibab Limestone is the rubbly Toroweap Formation and the cliff-forming Coconino Sandstone.

In the final stages of eruption, a lava flow broke out at the east base and rafted much of the cone interior away, hence the breached cone appearance seen in this image. </p><p>In the wake of the breach event, the vent went into fire-fountaining phase, armoring the summit and upper flanks with fused agglutinate. Immediately west (behind) of Strawberry Crater is O’Leary Peak, a rhyodacite dome. Behind that and just to the right is one of the peaks of San Francisco Mountain. <br /></p><p>Strawberry Crater's name probably stems from the strawberry-colored oxidized agglutinate that armors the cone. Another possibility is the abundance of strawberry-sized volcanic bombs that litter the ground around the vent.	-12408800.34	4224142.02	102100	0101000020E610000036DE26F016DE5BC0A11124FE9AB84140

About 50,000 years ago, a nickel-iron meteorite weighing 300,000 tons and 160 feet (49 m) in diameter traveling at 8 miles (12.9 km) per second blasted a crater ~ 4,000 feet (~1220 m) in diameter and 750 feet deep (~ 230 m). Crater fragments – some are quite large – are collectively referred to as the Canyon Diablo meteorite. </p><p>In 1903, Daniel M. Barringer, a mining engineer, postulated that the crater was the result of a meteorite impact. His company, Standard Iron Company, patented the land and the Barringer family owns the land to this day. Barringer’s meteorite origin was largely scoffed at and remained controversial into the 1950s. Eugene Shoemaker’s groundbreaking work here in 1960 confirmed Barringer’s hypothesis. </p><p>The powerful impact threw chunks of the existing Moenkopi, Kaibab, Toroweap Formations and the Coconino Sandstone into the air. They fell to the ground in reverse order resulting in the inverted stratigraphy found up to 1 mile (1.6 km) outboard of the rim. </p><p>From the work of David Kring and Jake Bailey (NASA/UA Space Imagery Center’s Impact Cratering Series), “sum of these effects is the destruction of vegetation over an area 300 to&nbsp; 580 square miles (800 to 1500 km2). Damage to vegetation would have extended over an additional 77 to&nbsp; 231 square miles (200 to 600 km2). Animals within 1.8 to 6.5 miles (3 to 10 km) of the impact site probably would been killed, with maiming injuries extending out to distances of about 10 to 15 miles (16 to 24 km). While these effects are severe, they are confined to the immediate region and did not cause extinctions. In fact, the newly formed bowl shaped depression soon filled with water providing a lake habitat (see graphic) for aquatic plants and animals. Recolonization of the area was probably accomplished in a few to ~100 years.”</p><p>Image: Meteor Crater aerial photo by Dale Nations (Northern Arizona University).

Basalt lava flows from Merriam Crater spilled into the Little Colorado River to the east, temporarily damming the river and leading to the formation of Grand Falls. The Little Colorado is an ephemeral stream, so the falls are usually dry. But spring snowmelt from the White Mountains and intense summer thunderstorms generate a churning mass of sediment-rich, chocolatey water. </p><p>The nearby Sproul is a large elliptical spatter cone with low ramparts of spatter, agglutinate, and rootless flows. <br /></p><p>Merriam Crater and the Sproul are the vanguard of eastern migration of volcanism in the San Francisco volcanic field. <br /></p><p>Image: Merriam Crater cinder cone (center) and the Sproul (right foreground).

On a clear day, the summit of Mount Elden boasts a spectacular view of the Painted Desert to the east. <br /></p><p>The Dry Lake Hills dome complex, located immediately to the northwest of Mount Elden, separates Elden from the San Francisco Mountain composite volcano. <br /></p><p>According to Richard Holm (Northern Arizona University, retired), " Paleozoic sedimentary rocks that crop out on and near Elden Mountain and Little Elden Mountain were tilted and faulted during emplacement of the dacite intrusions and older dacite of Elden Mountain. Structural relationships on the east side of Elden Mountain indicate that the strata were initially pushed up to steep dips and later subsided by rotation normal to strike and displacement along normal faults."</p><p>Image: South side of Mount Elden showing prominent lava flow lobes erupted from summit vents during the effusive stage of the dacite dome growth.
